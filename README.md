This HTML file creates a Ping Pong Score Keeper using Bulma CSS framework. It includes options to select the playing score and buttons to increment scores for two players. The game tracks scores, highlights the winner, and allows for score resets.

The JavaScript file defines player objects with scores and buttons. It updates scores upon button clicks, handles game logic such as determining the winner, and resets the game when necessary.
